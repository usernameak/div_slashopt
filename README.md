Divine Divinity Borderless Fullscreen Mod
=========================================

Improves game performance on modern Windows.

Requires [ThirteenAG's Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) to load the mod (name the loader's dll as `winmm.dll`, otherwise it will not work).

Installation
------------

WARNING: It was tested only with the Steam version and might not work with others!

1. Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/usernameak/div_slashopt/releases) (the package already contains the loader, so you don't have to download it separately).
2. Unpack it to the game root folder.
3. Run `configtool.exe`.
4. Set the renderer to `Direct3D` and the resolution to the native resolution of your display (or you can set it to a lower resolution, if you want to play the game in windowed mode).
5. Hit `Apply & Close`; if the configuration tool says `No ddraw devices found`, just press OK.
